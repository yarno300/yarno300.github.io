# Setting everything up

## Introduction
Welcome to our Code Breaker Engine tutorials! Here you can learn about our engine and how to use it! This will go easy over everything you need to know to start programming with Code Breaker!

So this tutorial is made to setup everything, so you can start programming with Code Breaker Engine! But if you already have everything setup then head over to [tutorial 2: basic rendering](basics.md)

## Installing
So firstly we need to install Code Breaker. We have our package hoster at pypi so you can easly install it by running:
```bash
  pip install code_breaker_engine
```

## Importing
Now we need to import Code Breaker to our project. We do it like this:
```python
  import code_breaker_engine as cb
```

## Ending
That was it, our engine is now setup! Now every function works from our main variable, as you might see later.
